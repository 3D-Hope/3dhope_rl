"""
Reward for non-penetration constraint using penetration depth.

Uses simplified penetration depth calculation based on AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) overlap.
Following the approach from the original authors who use sum of negative signed distances.

Penetration depth is better than overlap area or IoU because:
1. Provides magnitude information (how much to separate objects)
2. Physical meaning - directly actionable for corrections
3. Better gradient information for RL optimization
4. Handles different object scales consistently
