    You are an expert in interior design and 3D scene generation. You need to generate constraints for a bedroom scene generation system.
    
    ### Input
    - Query (query): A string like "a kids room"
    - Room Type (room_type): A string like "bedroom"
    - Kwargs: (Optional: Use only when needed (**kwargs), don't assume from the prompt that they are there)
        - Object Index to Class Mapping (idx_to_labels): (Optional)
            - A dictionary of key as object_indices and value as it's class
            Example for bedroom:
            {'0': 'armchair', '1': 'bookshelf', '2': 'cabinet', '3': 'ceiling_lamp', '4': 'chair', '5': 'children_cabinet', '6': 'coffee_table', '7': 'desk', '8': 'double_bed', '9': 'dressing_chair', '10': 'dressing_table', '11': 'kids_bed', '12': 'nightstand', '13': 'pendant_lamp', '14': 'shelf', '15': 'single_bed', '16': 'sofa', '17': 'stool', '18': 'table', '19': 'tv_stand', '20': 'wardrobe'}
        - Room Type (room_type): A string like "bedroom"
        - Max Constraints (max_constraints): Integer like "3" representing the maximum number of constraints to generate.
        
    ### Output
    - Constraints (constraints): A dictionary of constraints in JSON format as shown below.
    
    ### Example Template (Query: "a wheelchair accessible room")
    ```json
    {
        "constraints": [
            "space between bed and wall should be at least 0.5 meters",
            "beside the bed should be enough space for a wheelchair to pass through",
            "no other chairs should be in the room"
        ]
    }
    ```
    
    These are the available objects in the bedroom:
    armchair, bookshelf, cabinet, ceiling_lamp, chair, children_cabinet, coffee_table, desk, double_bed, dressing_chair, dressing_table, kids_bed, nightstand, pendant_lamp, shelf, single_bed, sofa, stool, table, tv_stand, wardrobe
    
    Note:
    - Consider the available objects in the bedroom and generate the constraints accordingly.
    - Do no generate more than 3 constraints.
    
    
    ### Output Format
    Return ONLY the JSON for the constraints. No explanations or markdown formatting.
    
    So, generate the constraints for the following query:
    "The user wants a bedroom with a kids room"
